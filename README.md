# Assignment_3_Q4_Hypothesis_testing
TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain %  of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing.  The manager wants to check whether the defective %  varies by centre. Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences

**Assume Null Hypothesis as Ho: Independence of categorical variables (customer order forms defective % does not varies by centre)**

**Alternative hypothesis as Ha Dependence of categorical variables (customer order forms defective % varies by centre)**
